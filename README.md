# bga-arknova-userstyle
Userstyle/CSS for Ark Nova on BGA displaying 2 player areas next to each other

## Prerequisites
<a href="https://github.com/openstyles/stylus#readme">Stylus</a> or some other way to apply a .user.styl or css to websites.
It should work fine on windows/screens 1920px or wider and with Ark Nova’s layout settings set as follows:
1) Player boards layout: Multiple view
2) Two columns layout: Enabled
3) Column sizes & Assocation board scale: adjust the sliders so that the AB fills the available height nicely
4) Projects on association board: Compacted

Remove `regexp("https://boardgamearena.com/archive/replay/.*")` from moz-doc after testing if you’d like.
